1. Challenges with single cell data and how PPI resolves it
1.1.what single cell data
1.2. zero inflation nature – causes and effects 
1.3. Excisting techniques to resolve it 
1.4. What is PPI networks, how it improves 

2. ScNET – a high level introduction
	* Data Processing
	* Auto Encoder architecture
		* Encoder
		* Graph Convolution Layer
		* Graph Attention Layer
		* KNN graph Pruning using attention Coefficcients

3. ScNET – applications of cell and gene embeddings, Pruned KNN graph, reconstructed cell x gene expression

3.1. Gene embeddings captures better functional annotation
	 * Aim here
	* embedding space correlation with known biological annotation and function -> how they have done
	*  Evaluation of functional annotation by clustering genes.
	*  embeddings capturing Functional information.
3.2. Coembedded Network captures biological pathways.
	 * Aim here
	* whats coembedded network
	* experiment in Malaria associated Bcells.
3.3. Evaluation of cell clustering.
	* Aim here
	* dataset used  - uskosin  what is it - ability to refine cell-cell similarity – here USL approaches outshined Foundation models - analysis on the on the recorded clusters
	* distribution of attention coefficients
	* analysis on cell cycle dataset – ARI used for performance calculation
3.4. ScNET reduces zero inflation and improves pathway analysis
	* Aim here   
	* is it capturing the expression dynamics of different cell population – GL261a mouse brain tumor model dataset- Analysis on the results  
	* AUPR of marker gene expression performance wrt other methods.
	* Quality of differential gene expression anlaysis for reconstructed gene expression data – Analysis
	* Differential dynamics within the same population under different biological conditions -Analysis
