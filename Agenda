1. Single-cell challenges and PPI solutions.

* what single cell data
* zero inflation nature – causes and effects 
* Excisting techniques to resolve it 
* What is PPI networks, how it improves 

2. ScNET: overview and architecture.
	* Data Processing
	* Auto Encoder architecture
		* Encoder
		* Graph Convolution Layer
		* Graph Attention Layer
		* KNN graph Pruning using attention Coefficcients

3. ScNET components: embeddings, pruned KNN, expression reconstruction

3.1. Gene embeddings improve functional annotation
	 * Aim here
	* embedding space correlation with known biological annotation and function -> how they have done
	*  Evaluation of functional annotation by clustering genes.
	*  embeddings capturing Functional information.
3.2. Co-embedded networks and pathways
	 * Aim here
	* whats coembedded network
	* experiment in Malaria associated Bcells.
3.3. Cell clustering evaluation
	* Aim here
	* dataset used  - uskosin  what is it - ability to refine cell-cell similarity – here USL approaches outshined Foundation models - analysis on the on the recorded clusters
	* distribution of attention coefficients
	* analysis on cell cycle dataset – ARI used for performance calculation
3.4. Reducing zero inflation and improving pathway analysis
	* Aim here   
	* is it capturing the expression dynamics of different cell population – GL261a mouse brain tumor model dataset- Analysis on the results  
	* AUPR of marker gene expression performance wrt other methods.
	* Quality of differential gene expression anlaysis for reconstructed gene expression data – Analysis
	* Differential dynamics within the same population under different biological conditions -Analysis
